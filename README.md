## Analog - PHP 5.3+ micro logging class

A short and simple logging class based on the idea of using closures for
configurability and extensibility. It functions as a static class, but you can
completely control the writing of log messages through a closure function
(aka [anonymous functions](http://ca3.php.net/manual/en/functions.anonymous.php)).

By default, this class will write to a file named `sys_get_temp_dir() . '/analog.txt'`
using the format `"machine - date - level - message\n"`, making it usable with no
customization necessary.

You'll find some pre-written handlers in the Analog/Handlers folder, with examples
for each in the examples folder. So far these include Mail, HTTP Post, Syslog, MongoDB,
FirePHP, and logging to a variable reference.

### Rationale

I wrote this because I wanted something very small and simple like
[KLogger](https://github.com/katzgrau/KLogger), and preferably not torn out
of a wider framework if possible. After searching, I wasn't happy with the
single-purpose libraries I found. With KLogger for example, I didn't want an
object instance but rather a static class, and I wanted more flexibility in
the back-end.

I also found some that had the flexibility also had more complexity, for example
[Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog) is 25 source files (not incl. tests).
With closures, this seemed to be a good balance of small (54 total lines of code
without comments) without sacrificing flexibility.

> same thing without it being considered stepping on toes :)

### Usage

```php
<?php

require_once ('Analog.php');

// Default logging to /tmp/analog.txt
Analog::log ('Log this error');

// Log to a MongoDB log collection
Analog::handler (function ($info) {
	static $conn = null;
	if (! $conn) {
		$conn = new Mongo ('localhost:27017');
	}
	$conn->mydb->log->insert ($info);
});

// Log an alert
Analog::log ('The sky is falling!', Analog::ALERT);

// Log some debug info
Analog::log ('Debugging info', Analog::DEBUG);

?>
```
